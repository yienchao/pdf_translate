================================================================================
METHOD DETAILS
================================================================================

METHOD 1: REDACT AND REPLACE
----------------------------
Approach:
  - Uses PyMuPDF's redaction feature
  - Marks French text areas for removal
  - Applies redactions (removes text)
  - Inserts English text in same positions

Pros:
  + Clean approach using built-in PyMuPDF redaction
  + Properly removes original text objects
  + Maintains PDF structure

Cons:
  - Some font warnings (couldn't load custom fonts)
  - Larger file size (3.39 MB)
  - May not preserve exact font appearance

Output: AR-001 - METHOD1 - REDACT.pdf


METHOD 2: DECOMPOSE AND REBUILD
--------------------------------
Approach:
  - Creates new PDF document from scratch
  - Extracts all elements (images, drawings, text)
  - Translates text
  - Rebuilds page with all elements

Pros:
  + Complete control over reconstruction
  + Smallest file size (1.65 MB)
  + Successfully copied 14 images and 2472 drawing elements
  + Inserted 847 text elements

Cons:
  - Most complex approach
  - May miss some subtle page elements
  - Longer processing time

Output: AR-001 - METHOD2 - DECOMPOSE.pdf


METHOD 3: REPORTLAB WITH IMAGE BACKGROUND
------------------------------------------
Approach:
  - Renders original page as high-quality image
  - Uses image as background
  - Covers French text with white rectangles
  - Overlays English text on top

Pros:
  + Guaranteed visual accuracy (uses original as image)
  + Simple and reliable
  + No missing elements

Cons:
  - Largest file size (4.53 MB) due to embedded image
  - Text underneath is not truly removed (just covered)
  - Background is rasterized (not vector)

Output: AR-001 - METHOD3 - REPORTLAB.pdf

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

BEST FOR QUALITY:
  Method 2 (Decompose and Rebuild)
  - Smallest file size
  - True vector graphics preserved
  - Professional quality output

BEST FOR SIMPLICITY:
  Method 3 (ReportLab)
  - Guaranteed to look like original
  - Easiest to understand
  - Good for complex layouts

BEST FOR PROPER TEXT REMOVAL:
  Method 1 (Redact)
  - Uses proper PDF redaction
  - Text is actually removed, not covered
  - Good middle ground

================================================================================
COMMON ISSUES FOUND
================================================================================

1. Font Handling:
   - Method 1 had warnings about custom fonts
   - All methods fell back to Helvetica for English text
   - This is acceptable as English text is typically shorter

2. Special Characters:
   - Some accented characters (é, à, ô) may not translate perfectly
   - This is due to the dictionary-based approach

3. File Sizes:
   - Method 3 is largest due to embedded high-res image
   - Method 2 is smallest (only vector elements)
   - Method 1 is medium (keeps original structure + new text)

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED USAGE
================================================================================

For your ARCH E dimension architectural drawings:

PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: Method 2 (Decompose and Rebuild)
  - Best quality-to-size ratio
  - Professional output
  - Smallest file size for sharing/storage

BACKUP OPTION: Method 1 (Redact)
  - Use if Method 2 misses any elements
  - Proper text removal
  - Acceptable file size

FALLBACK: Method 3 (ReportLab)
  - Use if you need guaranteed visual accuracy
  - Good for presentations where file size doesn't matter
  - Simplest code to maintain

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Open and review all three output PDFs
2. Compare text placement and readability
3. Check that all graphics/symbols are preserved
4. Verify technical drawings are still accurate
5. Choose the method that best fits your needs

All scripts are ready to use:
  - method1_redact_replace.py
  - method2_decompose_rebuild.py
  - method3_reportlab.py
  - translation_dictionary.py (shared dictionary)

To translate other PDFs, simply modify the input/output paths in each script.
